TODOs
=====

This file contains some of the further developments and improvements planned for easyp2p which are not (yet) mentioned as TODOs in the source code.
The items are listed in no particular order:

* Make the download location for the account statements configurable, i.e. don't hardcode it to p2p_downloads/
* Clean up the download directory after the result file has been successfully generated
* Parallelize downloading account statements for different platforms
* Make sure easyp2p runs on at least Ubuntu, Debian and Windows 10
* Remember the selected platforms for the next run
* Generate generic test input and result files, at least for the parser
* Show (daily) account balances where available to check efficiency of the platform
